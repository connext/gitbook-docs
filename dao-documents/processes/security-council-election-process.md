# Security Council Election Process

{% hint style="warning" %}
This document is currently subject to public review before being finalized. If you notice a revision that needs to be made or have feedback, please [request a revision](https://github.com/connext/gitbook-docs/issues/new) or start a conversation with us on Discord at [https://discord.com/invite/everclear](https://discord.com/invite/everclear)
{% endhint %}

Elections for the Security Council are held annually, excluding an initial 6-month bootstrapping phase, during which the Connext Foundation will appoint the initial council.

Before each election cycle, the Connext DAO will open a one-month-long call for candidates, followed by a 5-day long voting period. The top 12 candidates will then be inducted into the council for one term that will last for 12 months. Serving multiple terms will be possible, however, it will require candidates to submit a new application and be elected into the Security Council through a formal vote.

NEXT token holders can vote for the Security Council or delegate their voting power so that the representative of their choice can vote on their behalf. Voting power depends on the number of tokes delegated to an address and is such that 1 token represents 1 vote.

Changes to these elections may be proposed by the DAO, but not in an ongoing election cycle.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: Prior to the first election, the DAO can post an RFC to discuss whether the term duration should be 6 or 12 months.
