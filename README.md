## Components of the Connext Collective

### The Connext DAO

The Connext DAO, comprised of NEXT token holders, governs critical aspects of Connext's smart contracts and is responsible for allocating resources from the DAO treasury to fund protocol development and growth.

### The Connext Foundation

The Connext Foundation is a Cayman Islands foundation company that was established for the purpose of supporting the Connext ecosystem. The Connext Foundation is an independent entity with fiduciary responsibilities to support the Connext ecosystem through activities such as strategic stewardship and partnership initiatives.

### Core Contributors

Core Contributors are organizations funded by the DAO to undertake research and development efforts, aimed at improving the Connext protocol. Core Contributors engage in an open Connext Improvement Proposal (CIP) process to solicit input from the community and propose upgrades.

### The Broader Connext Community

The Connext ecosystem encompasses a diverse community comprising users and infrastructure operators, such as routers. This engaged community actively participates in the protocol's utilization, provides feedback, and aids in maintaining the protocol's robustness.
