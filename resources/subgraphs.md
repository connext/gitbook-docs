# Subgraphs

Connext has a GraphQL API Endpoint hosted by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction#what-the-graph-is) called a subgraph for indexing and organizing data from the Connext smart contracts. Subgraph information is serviced by a decentralized group of server operators called Indexers.

This subgraph is can be used to query Connext bridge transactions, transactions statuses and more.
